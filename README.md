## Description & Purpose
This shell is the ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting.

WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol. A standard SOAP based protocol 
that allows hardware and operating systems from different vendors to interoperate. Microsoft included it in their Operating 
Systems in order to make life easier to system adminsitrators.

This program can be used on any Microsoft Windows Servers with this feature enabled (usually at port 5985), of course only 
if you have credentials and permissions to use it. So we can say that it could be used in a post-exploitation hacking/pentesting 
phase. The purpose of this program is to provide nice and easy-to-use features for hacking. It can be used with legitimate 
purposes by system administrators as well but the most of its features are focused on hacking/pentesting stuff.
